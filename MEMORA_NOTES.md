1. Update App Version (Optional but Recommended)

Before building, it's good practice to update your app's version number in pubspec.yaml.

1 version: 1.0.1+2 # Example: incrementing from 1.0.0+1

2. Clean Your Project

It's always a good idea to clean your project before a release build to avoid any potential
issues.

1 flutter clean

3. Get Dependencies

Ensure you have all the latest dependencies.

1 flutter pub get

4. Build the Android App Bundle

This command will create a release version of your app that you can upload to the Play Store.

1 flutter build appbundle

5. Locate the App Bundle

After the build is complete, you'll find the app bundle file (.aab) in the following directory:

1 build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

6. Upload to the Google Play Store

1. Go to the Google Play Console (https://play.google.com/console).
2. Select your app.
3. Go to the "Production" page (or "Internal testing", "Closed testing" if you are testing
    first).
4. Click "Create new release".
5. Upload the app-release.aab file you located in the previous step.
6. Follow the instructions on the Play Console to fill in release notes and submit your app
    for review.

Let me know if you'd like me to run any of these commands for you.
